-- Simple console utility which parses PSD and return list of fonts:
    -- script is supplied with argument which is full path to the PSD file
        - if no path is given or there is no PSD throw some error
        - if PSD is empty/blank or not layers are there, than end script execution with appropriate message.
    -- script will go through each layer and gather/filter font titles
    -- at the end script ouputs simple list of all fonts found

-- Additional Options:
        - handle multiple files, directories
        - let user choose parameters to be extracted, to remove duplicates or not, sorting, etc ( would be better with NodeJS ).
        - fonts with size, line height, line-spacing, font-size
        - wrap it up with NodeJS and Express framework
        - gather statistics on how many font variations is there, how many duplicates
        - various formats of output for the list of fonts
